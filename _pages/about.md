My name is **Shiwu Zhang (张世武)**. I am a postdoc at the Research Center for Astronomical Computing, Zhejiang Lab, China. 

I am interested in exploring the ecosystem of galaxies and their gas environment at the high redshift. 
Currently, my research interests mainly focus on unveiling the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its connection to the host galaxy. 
Broadly, my research interests include but are not limited to, imaging the CGM extended emissions through the integral field spectrograph (IFS), mocking the CGM emission based on the cosmological simulations, estimating the baryon density of the warm CGM through the fast radio burst, and constraining the cosmological model through the imaging/spectroscopic survey.
