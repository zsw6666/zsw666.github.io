My name is **Shiwu Zhang (张世武)**. I am a postdoc at the Research Center for Astronomical Computing, Zhejiang Lab, China. 
I was supervised by [Zheng Cai](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zcai/) at the [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).  

I am interested in the ecosystem of galaxies and their gas environment at the high redshift. 
Currently, I am focusing on unveiling the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its connection to the ionization source (AGN & galaxy). 
Broadly, my research interests include but are not limited to, imaging the CGM nebulae through the integral field spectrograph (IFS), mocking the CGM emission based on the cosmological simulations, estimating the baryon density of the warm CGM through the fast radio burst, and constraining the cosmological model through the imaging/spectroscopic survey.
