Inspiraling streams of enriched gas observed around a massive galaxy 11 billion years ago
====

**Abstract:** Stars form in galaxies, from gas that has been accreted from the intergalactic medium. Simulations have shown that recycling of gas—the reaccretion of gas that was previously ejected from a galaxy—could sustain star formation in the early Universe. We observe the gas surrounding a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3 and detect emission lines from neutral hydrogen, helium, and ionized carbon that extend 100 kiloparsecs from the galaxy. The kinematics of this circumgalactic gas is consistent with an inspiraling stream. The carbon abundance indicates that the gas had already been enriched with elements heavier than helium, previously ejected from a galaxy. We interpret the results as evidence of gas recycling during high-redshift galaxy assembly.

Revealing the Gas Recycling in the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) Utilizing a Luminous Lya Nebula around a Type II Quasar at z = 2.6 with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI)
====

**Abstract:** How galaxies acquire material from the circumgalactic medium is a key question in galaxy evolution. Recent observations and simulations show that gas recycling could be an important avenue for star formation. This paper presents Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field unit spectroscopic observations on a type II quasar, Q1517 + 0055 at z = 2.65, a pilot study of our Lya nebulae sample at $$z \approx 2$$. We revealed diffuse emission of the Lya 1216, HeII 1640, and CIV 1549 on the projected physical scale of 122, 45, and 79 kpc, respectively. The total Lya luminosity is $$L_{\rm Ly\alpha}=3.04\pm 0.02 \times 10^{44}$$ erg s$$^{-1}$$. The line ratio diagnostics shows that HeII/Lya = 0.08, and C IV/Lya = 0.28, consistent with the photoionization including recombination and photon pumping. We also identify the associated HI and CIV absorption from the spectra. By fitting the spectra, we derive both the column density and the velocity. We find that the velocity profile from both the absorption and the He ii emission exhibit increasing trends. Moreover, both the line ratio diagnostic from the emission and the column density ratio from the absorption confirm that the cool gas metallicity is $$\geq Z_{\odot}$$. From detailed modeling and estimation, gas recycling might be a more plausible interpretation compared with the scenario of a powerful outflow.

Studying the CircumgAlactic Medium and galaxy Ecosystem through the Extended Emission (SCAME$$^{3}$$) I: Methodology of utilizing the Extended Emission to Test the AGN model at $$z=2-3$$
====

**Intro:** Exploring the physical nature of the high-z active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been a hot topic in recent years. Some observations find that the well-accepted AGN unified model seems to be invalid at high redshift. Instead, observational evidence supports that the high-z AGN is likely to follow the `evolutionary scenario`, in which the obscured AGN evolves to the unobscured stage by sweeping off the surrounding dust and gas through the powerful feedback. Nevertheless, directly resolving the small-scale AGN structure at high redshift is beyond current observational ability. In this study, we prompt a new approach to test the AGN unified model through the CGM extended emissions. By simulating the CGM extended emissions (Lya, HeII, Ha, and CIV) based on the unified model with the FIRE simulations, we can explore the difference in the CGM emissions of the unobscured and obscured AGN. Such comparison will help us to figure out How the CGM extended emission can be used for testing the AGN unified model.
