Inspiraling streams of enriched gas observed around a massive galaxy 11 billion years ago
====

**Abstract:** Stars form in galaxies, from gas that has been accreted from the intergalactic medium. Simulations have shown that recycling of gas—the reaccretion of gas that was previously ejected from a galaxy—could sustain star formation in the early Universe. We observe the gas surrounding a massive galaxy at redshift 2.3 and detect emission lines from neutral hydrogen, helium, and ionized carbon that extend 100 kiloparsecs from the galaxy. The kinematics of this circumgalactic gas is consistent with an inspiraling stream. The carbon abundance indicates that the gas had already been enriched with elements heavier than helium, previously ejected from a galaxy. We interpret the results as evidence of gas recycling during high-redshift galaxy assembly. ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02344))

Revealing the Gas Recycling in the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) Utilizing a Luminous Lya Nebula around a Type II Quasar at z = 2.6 with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI)
====

**Abstract:** How galaxies acquire material from the circumgalactic medium is a key question in galaxy evolution. Recent observations and simulations show that gas recycling could be an important avenue for star formation. This paper presents Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field unit spectroscopic observations on a type II quasar, Q1517 + 0055 at z = 2.65, a pilot study of our Lya nebulae sample at $$z \approx 2$$. We revealed diffuse emission of the Lya 1216, HeII 1640, and CIV 1549 on the projected physical scale of 122, 45, and 79 kpc, respectively. The total Lya luminosity is $$L_{\rm Ly\alpha}=3.04\pm 0.02 \times 10^{44}$$ erg s$$^{-1}$$. The line ratio diagnostics shows that HeII/Lya = 0.08, and C IV/Lya = 0.28, consistent with the photoionization including recombination and photon pumping. We also identify the associated HI and CIV absorption from the spectra. By fitting the spectra, we derive both the column density and the velocity. We find that the velocity profile from both the absorption and the He ii emission exhibit increasing trends. Moreover, both the line ratio diagnostic from the emission and the column density ratio from the absorption confirm that the cool gas metallicity is $$\geq Z_{\odot}$$. From detailed modeling and estimation, gas recycling might be a more plausible interpretation compared with the scenario of a powerful outflow. ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14224))

Testing the AGN unified model with simulated emission lines from the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
====

**Intro:** The CGM around unobscured AGN has received much attention in recent years. Comparatively, nebulae associated with obscured AGN have been less studied. Here, we simulate the Ly$$\alpha$$, H$$\alpha$$, and HeII nebulae around the two types of AGN at z=2-3 based on the unified model to show their differences and to test if these nebulae can be used to constrain the AGN model. For this purpose, we use ten massive systems from the FIRE simulations. We post-process the data with the cloudy and the Ly$$\alpha$$ radiative transfer code, RASCAS. Overall, we find that the Ly$$\alpha$$ nebulae around the unobscured AGN (type-I nebulae) and obscured AGN (type-II nebulae) do not exhibit significant differences in the total luminosity and area. Whereas, the type-II nebulae exhibit less symmetric morphologies, flatter surface brightness profiles, and larger emission line widths (at R > 10 kpc) than those of the type-I nebulae. Moreover, these nebulae properties exhibit complicated correlations with the AGN, which indicates that nebulae observations can be applied to constrain the AGN engine. However, independent observations on nebulae in the mentioned emissions are insufficient to test the unified model as a priori in observations is not possible to know the direction and opening angle of the ionization cone. We prompt that the joint observations of Ly$$\alpha$$ nebulae and radio jets can help to reveal the ionization cone to probe the unified model. Our calculations suggest that this method requires > 75 type-II Ly$$\alpha$$ nebulae with current instruments to reach a confidence level of > 95%. (*Under revision*)

Revealing the connection between the CGM nebulae and SMBH at $$z=2-3$$ through the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI)?
====
**Intro:** By exploring the nebulae at $$z=3-2$$ collected by KCWI in 2017-2023, we find that the extent of the Ly$$\alpha$$ nebulae which is quantified by the scale length ($$r_{\rm h}$$) connects to the mass of the supermassive black hole. This could be a unversial correlation for high-$$z$$ quasars which can help us to understand the evolution of the SMBH. This work is under preparation.
